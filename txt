    '<p>The idea is to use the output of <a href="https://www.manpagez.com/man/8/ioreg/"><code>ioreg</code></a> to get the battery levels of the keyboard, trackpad, and mouse, and to then use that information to tell the user it’s time to recharge. You may be thinking, “isn’t that what the low battery notifications are for?” Yes, but the problem is those notifications always seem to appear when you’re in the middle of work and don’t want to be interrupted. The idea behind a notice on your Stream Deck or in your menu bar is that you don’t need to dismiss it to get back to work, and it’s still there to remind you when you have time to plug in or change batteries.</p>\n' +
    '<p>As a practical matter, I couldn’t just tweak TJ’s solution to make it work with BitBar. TJ is a shell scripting wizard, and his script is strong evidence of that. Although I can follow the logic of what he’s doing, I would never feel comfortable trying to adjust it to my needs. So I took his ideas, rewrote them in Python, and added the parts necessary to drive BitBar.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The script, or <em>plugin</em>, as BitBar likes to call it, is <code>batteries.1h.py</code>, and it gives me a menu bar item that looks like this:<sup id="fnref:snell"><a href="#fn:snell" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>\n' +

    '<p>When one of the input devices gets low on battery, the menu bar icon changes from a battery,🔋, to a plug, 🔌, to tell me its time to plug in. And if I ever connect an I/O device that isn’t a keyboard, trackpad, or mouse, the icon will change to a joystick, 🕹.</p>\n' +

    '<p>The key to this was the recognition that the output of</p>\n' +
    '<pre><code>ioreg -r -k BatteryPercent\n' +
    '</code></pre>\n' +
    '<p>can be thought of as a series of paragraphs, one for each I/O device with an entry named BatteryPercent. The script captures the output of this command in Line 21, splits it into paragraphs on Line 28, and extracts the product name and battery level for each device. This information is used to construct the multiline text output in Lines 50–56 that BitBar parses to assemble the menu.</p>\n' +
    '<p>One weird thing I found while writing this script is that <code>ioreg</code> uses the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_Roman">MacRoman text encoding</a> for its output.  Both of my devices used possessives in their product names, e.g., “Dr. Drang’s Trackpad,” and the curly apostrophe has a byte value (in hex) of <code>0xD5</code>. When I first started looking through <code>ioreg</code>’s output, I saw that this was rendered in my terminal as “Dr. DrangÕs Trackpad,” because <code>0xD5</code> is Õ in UTF-8 (and Latin-1). Thus the call to <code>decode(\'macroman\') in Line 21. I realize updating</code>ioreg` is not one of Apple’s most pressing concerns, but it’s been two decades, Craig. None of Apple’s command line utilities should be spitting out MacRoman anymore.</p>\n' +
    '<p>I must note that TJ’s script is more tolerant of unusual output from <code>ioreg</code> than mine is and handles it in a more granular way. I flatly ignore certain useless outputs, because I just don’t think they’ll ever show up. It’s part of my devil-may-care personality.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Anyway, this was a fun exercise, and I now have another potentially useful item in my menu bar. It’ll be months before I know whether I take heed of this warning, but one thing I do know is that I’ve been dismissing low battery notifications for years; a warning in the menu bar has to be better than that.</p>\n' +

    '<li>I don’t have to think about moving to a new aggregator because the one I’m currently using just went out of business or decided to increase its subscription fee. Or because an aggregator I’m not using just reduced its fee.</li>\n' +

Some of this has been forced on me—when an app or service stops working, there’s no way to avoid thinking about the alternatives—but a lot has been self-inflicted.

    '<p>I’ve been using Python 3 for quite a while, but it’s been a version installed through <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, not one that came from Apple. The reasons are</p>\n' +
    '<ol>\n' +

    '<li>I didn’t install Catalina on either of my Macs until this past month.</li>\n' +
    '</ol>\n' +
    '<p>I intend to keep using the Anaconda-installed version as my regular Python because its environment has all the tools I regularly use in my work: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. But the BitBar scripts were a good way to try out Apple’s Python 3; they needed Python 3’s UTF-8 support<sup id="fnref:utf8"><a href="#fn:utf8" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and didn’t need any of those math/science libraries.</p>\n' +
    '<p>While I said above that Apple provides Python 3 in Catalina, that may be stretching the definition of “provide.” If you look in <code>/usr/bin</code>, you’ll find something called <code>python3</code>, but that something may be just a placeholder. If you haven’t installed the Command Line Developer Tools, trying to execute a script via <code>/usr/bin/python3</code> will get you an error message about an “invalid active developer path.” This happened to me on one of my Macs; presumably, the CLDTs had already been installed on the other Mac and were updated when I switched to Catalina.</p>\n' +
    '<p>If you need to install the CLDTs, <a href="https://flaviocopes.com/fix-xcrun-error-invalid-active-developer-path/">this explanation by Flavio Copes</a> of how to do so via the <code>xcode-select</code> command is clear and concise. Once you’ve done so, you can test your new Python 3 by running</p>\n' +

    '<p>at the command line. You should get <code>Python 3.7.3</code> as the response. This was the version released over a year ago, which means its remarkably fresh for an Apple-supplied command-line tool.</p>\n' +
    '<p>If you need to install third-party libraries, as I did with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/mechanize/">Mechanize</a> and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a> libraries used in my library BitBar script, you’ll have to run the Python 3 version of <code>pip</code> like this:</p>\n' +
    '<pre><code>/usr/bin/pip3 install mechanize\n' +
    '</code></pre>\n' +
    '<p>You’ll probably get a warning that your version of <code>pip</code> isn’t up to date. As with Python 3 itself, the <code>pip</code> that comes from Apple is over a year old. It’ll still work.</p>\n' +
    '<p>As I said earlier, I don’t expect to be using Apple’s Python 3 in the future, but it’s nice to see that Mac users can use a modern Python without resort to third-party systems like Homebrew or Anaconda.</p>\n' +

    '<p>The second BitBar notice is a little more complicated. It gets the status of items my family has checked out or on hold at our local library and presents them in the menu. If a checked-out item is due soon (or overdue) or if an item on hold is ready to be picked up, the book item in the menu bar is red; otherwise, it’s blue.

    '<p>BitBar uses the daunting words “plugin” and “API” to describe the code that configures these menu bar items, but they’re just programs that write lines of text to standard output.

    '<p>It’s not that I’m actually putting two fingers on the watch face, but something about the way my right arm touches the face when I cross my arms sets this off. Since I have never deliberately used this feature to get the watch to announce the time, turning it off is an easy call.</p>\n' +
    '<p>After turning off Speak Time, I remembered that I missed a phone call earlier in the day, presumably because my watch didn’t alert me (my phone is always on silent).

    '<p>Again, I’ve never muted my watch on purpose by covering its face, but I’ve done it inadvertently many times. A couple of years ago, this happened so often I thought someone was gaslighting me. Whenever I learned that I’d missed an alert, I checked the settings to find that Silent Mode was on. It was months before I realized that Cover to Mute wasn’t a temporary thing to silence a single alert, but a permanent switch to Silent Mode. I still think the description of how it works is poorly worded.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Anyway, I’m sure that more of these will come up over the next few weeks, as I find my watch alerting me when I don’t want it to and not alerting me when I do. Whenever I figure out the fix, I’ll take a screenshot and add it to my Apple Watch Settings note.</p>\n' +

They overlapped to some extent, so I put them together into <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/74ccef08af784e78abfe8a4448f8ae9b">a new Warhol</a>.</p>\n' +
    '<p>First, David Sparks pointed out that it would be helpful to end the shortcut by opening Photos so you can both see the new image and do something with it. And Leddy, <a href="https://talk.automators.fm/t/dr-drang-s-warhol-shortcut/7901">in the Automators discussion forum</a>, had a suggestion for running it both the Share Sheet and directly from Shortcuts without running into memory constraints. As I was trying out Leddy’s suggestion, I learned that Warhol <em>wasn’t</em> constrained by memory when run from the Share Sheet. (Apparently I’d run into that problem during one of the the early iterations of Warhol and never went back to check if the later improvements made it efficient enough to avoid the memory constraint.)</p>\n' +
    '<p>So now Warhol can be run from both Shortcuts and the Share Sheet in Photos. If it’s run from Shortcuts, it finishes by opening Photos. If it’s run from the Share Sheet, Photos is already open.</p>\n' +

In this, Phil was carrying on the tradition of Steve Jobs, who was more than happy to slow down a presentation and go into the details when he thought it was warranted. Look up Steve’s introduction of the iPad if you need to see an example of that.</p>\n' +

    '<p>The numerical trick in choosing the sizes is to come up with a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 that is the width you want for the final image (ignoring the 1-pixel separator lines). This will have to be a multiple of 120, which is the least common multiple of those numbers. I chose a final image size of 3840, which I sometimes think is too large, but I do like to zoom in on the individual images and still have decent detail. If you don’t want to use storage space and bandwidth as profligately as I do, choose a smaller multiple of 120 (1200? 2400?) and divide that by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 to get the <code>width</code>s.</p>\n' +
    '<p>It’s not obvious how to use a variable as the repetition count in a Repeat loop, as is done in Steps 7 and 13. When you first add a Repeat step, you’re given a count that you can change by tapping the plus or minus buttons that appear when you touch the count button.</p>\n' +
    '<p><img alt="Repeat action" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200804-Repeat%20action.jpg" title="Repeat action" width="50%"/></p>\n' +
    '<p>To use a variable for the count instead of a predefined number, you have to <em>press and hold</em> on the count button. A menu like this will appear,</p>\n' +
    '<p><img alt="Variable repetition menu" class="ss" src="https://leancrew.com/all-this/images2020/20200806-Variable%20repetition%20menu.png" title="Variable repetition menu" width="50%"/></p>\n' +
    '<p>and you’ll be able to choose either a regular variable or a magic variable for the number of repetitions. This is a terrible, undiscoverable design decision. And even after I did discover it (through Googling), I was disappointed to see that the step reads “Repeat count” instead of “Repeat count times.”</p>\n' +
    '<p>You may be wondering where the <code>photos</code> variable in Steps 10 and 14 came from. Basically, it gets made up on the spot and accumulates additional values in a list with each pass through the loop. Here’s the description of <span class="menu">Add to Variable</span>:</p>\n' +
    '<blockquote>\n' +
    '<p>Appends this action’s input to the specified variable, creating the variable if it does not exist.</p>\n' +
    '<p>This allows you to make a variable hold multiple items.</p>\n' +
    '</blockquote>\n' +
    '<p>If you’re used to writing in stricter languages, it may bother you that you don’t have to initialize <code>photos</code> with an empty list before adding values to it. If you’ve programmed in Perl, you’ll probably feel right at home.</p>\n' +
    '<p>I often feel guilty about presenting a completed automation, one that I’ve spent a lot of time writing and rewriting to make clearer, more efficient, and more idiomatic to the language in which it’s written. I can assure you that even a silly program like Warhol didn’t spring out fully formed, like Athena from Zeus’s head. It started out both much simpler, in that it handled fewer grid sizes and couldn’t tint the images, and more complicated, in that it didn’t take advantage of some of the niceties of Shortcuts.</p>\n' +
    '<p>For example, the earliest versions of Warhol presented only a few grid sizes and used a repetitive <span class="menu">Choose from Menu</span> section to set the size of the list of images. It was only after I had the basic logic of the shortcut worked out that I switched to using the dictionary of dictionaries to handle the different grid sizes. That change cleaned up a lot of code.</p>\n' +
    '<p>The earlier versions of Warhol also had no logic for resizing the base image before assembling it into a list of images. The <span class="menu">Resize Image</span> step came at the end, only after <span class="menu">Combine Images</span> had created a truly enormous grid image, usually well over 10,000 pixels wide. These early versions often ran <em>very</em> slowly because of all the data they were slinging around.</p>\n' +
    '<p>I don’t consider any of these inefficiencies in code size or running time to be bugs. They were part of my normal process of development:</p>\n' +
    '<ol>\n' +
    '<li>Order my thoughts to understand what the problem is and how to solve it.</li>\n' +
    '<li>Work out some code that implements that solution.</li>\n' +
    '<li>Improve the code to make it tighter, easier to understand, and, if necessary, faster.</li>\n' +
    '</ol>\n' +
    '<p>Steps 2 and 3 usually lead to revisions in what I came up with in Step 1. Working out a solution almost always gives me a better understanding of what the problem really is.</p>\n' +
    '<p>Ultimately, Warhol is a solution in search of a problem. It’s the kind of automation I create because I think writing it would be fun and I would learn something in the process. On those terms, it was a success.</p>\n' +
